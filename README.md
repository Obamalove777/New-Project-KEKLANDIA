# New-Project-KEKLANDIA
Building AI course project
Summary
The objective of this project is to know the best local service (telecommunications, electricity, gas and more) using AI to hire the one that best fits the budget, quality and level of customer satisfaction.

Background
In each locality, depending on its urbanization, there are different service providers that despite already having a reputation, their level of service is not always the same in all the localities where it can reach, which generates great discontent in the population. In other words, the service provided by the number one provider in the capital is not the same in the most remote location where it still has coverage.

A clear example is with the companies that provide Internet services and that many times because of the reputation it has is chosen, however, when verifying the satisfaction of the clients of that locality it can be seen that it is not the best for that area.

How is it used?
Based on the location, service and budget that are entered, verify based on the level of satisfaction of the customers on that location to the best provider that the customer can hire. The information could be displayed in a web or mobile application.

The necessary information could be processed separately to provide a better end-user experience and can be constantly updated to generate better predictions.

Data sources and AI methods
Most of the information in the case of my country, Mexico, can be consulted through government institutions, where historical data on complaints can be consulted or these indices can be requested directly to service providers.

IA mechanisms that might be used for information processing are:

Linear / logistic regresion
Neural networks
Challenges
There is a complicated problem to solve because most people do not express their complaints directly to the service provider, leaving that data adrift. This behavior is mainly caused by corruption that may exist in the government institution or with the administration of the service provider.

What next?
Find all providers in the locality.
Investigate customer satisfaction levels using the data exposed to the public or requesting this information directly.
Generate algorithm for selecting the best provider.
Acknowledgments
To the government of Mexico for having mechanisms for consulting information.
